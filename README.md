# WorthTheHours

**WorthTheHours** is a native Android app that helps you rethink spending by converting prices into **hours of work**.

Instead of asking *“Can I afford this?”*, the app helps you ask a more meaningful question:

> **“How many hours of my life does this cost?”**

By visualizing expenses in terms of working time, WorthTheHours encourages conscious, mindful purchasing decisions.
